## Discussion

This command provides a redemption code to complete installing an app. Use this when `InstallApplication` returns `NeedsRedemption`, or when `ManagedApplicationList` returns `NeedsRedemption` for the status of the app.

Sending a redemption code to an app that doesn’t need it produces an error.
