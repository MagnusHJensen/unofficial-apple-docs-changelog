A dictionary that defines the quality-of-service settings.

**Platforms:** iOS 10.0, iPadOS 10.0, macOS 10.13, tvOS 9.0, visionOS 1.0, watchOS 3.2

## Properties

### QoSMarkingAllowListAppIdentifiers

- **Type:** `[string]`
- **Required:** No

An array of app bundle identifiers that defines the allow list for L2 and L3 marking for traffic that goes to the Wi-Fi network. If the array isn’t present, but the `QoSMarkingPolicy` key is present — even empty — no apps can use L2 and L3 marking.

Available in iOS 14.5 and later, macOS 14 and later, tvOS 9 and later, visionOS 1 and later, and watchOS 3.2 and later.

### QoSMarkingAppleAudioVideoCalls

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `true`

If `true`, adds audio and video traffic of built-in audio or video services, such as FaceTime and Wi-Fi Calling, to the allow list for L2 and L3 marking for traffic that goes to the Wi-Fi network.

Available in iOS 10 and later, macOS 10.13 and later, tvOS 9 and later, visionOS 1 and later, and watchOS 3.2 and later.

### QoSMarkingEnabled

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `true`

If `true`, disables L3 marking and only uses L2 marking for traffic that goes to the Wi-Fi network.

If `false`, the system behaves as if Wi-Fi doesn’t have an association with a Cisco QoS fast lane network.

Available in iOS 10 and later, macOS 10.13 and later, tvOS 9 and later, visionOS 1 and later, and watchOS 3.2 and later.
