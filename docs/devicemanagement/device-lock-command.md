## Discussion

You can display a message and phone number on the Lock Screen if the user has set a passcode for the device, it isn’t a Shared iPad, and it isn’t in Lost Mode. In macOS, this command uses the Find My framework to lock a device, and fails if there’s no recovery partition on the device.
