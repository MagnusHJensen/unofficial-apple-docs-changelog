# Authenticating with a Device Enrollment Program (DEP) Server

Communicate securely with a DEP web service, using a server token.

## Overview

The device enrollment program (DEP) uses a server token to allow a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server to securely communicate with a DEP web service.

### Get a DEP Server Token

To get a DEP server token, the user must complete the following steps. The MDM server product can help by automating some of the steps.

1. Generate a public/private key pair in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format for the MDM server, and store the private key securely on the server.
2. Sign into the DEP web portal.
3. Create a new virtual MDM server.
4. Upload a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate that contains the public key generated in step 1.
5. Download the S/MIME-encrypted (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) token file generated by the program web portal.
6. Decrypt the S/MIME token.
7. Upload the token file to the MDM server.

The token consists of these 4 items: the consumer key, the consumer secret, the access token, and the access secret. See [Examining Server Tokens](/documentation/devicemanagement/examining-server-tokens) for more details.

### Deploy the Server Token

The server tokens can be deployed automatically or manually.

### Use the OAuth Credentials

Each service request to the MDM enrollment service must include an `X-ADM-Auth-Session` header. If the request does not have a valid `X-ADM-Auth-Session` header, or the auth token has expired, the server returns an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` error. A new `X-ADM-Auth-Session` can be requested by using the `https://mdmenrollment.apple.com/session` endpoint. This endpoint supports the OAuth 1.0a protocol for accessing protected resources.

OAuth requests must provide the server-token fields along with a timestamp (in seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT) and a cryptographically random nonce that must be unique for all requests made with a given timestamp. Sign the request using HMAC-SHA1, as described in [http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#signing_process](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#signing_process).  A request might look like:

```javascript
GET /session HTTP/1.1    
Authorization: OAuth realm="ADM",
       oauth_consumer_key="CK_00fadb3d36c6094cf479838455321b7c",
       oauth_token="AT_O2109279022Oe03b641fd6f07d7face7894211d521fd8bef09c3O137392",
       oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
       oauth_signature="wOJIO9A2W5mFwDgiDvZbTSMK%2FPY%3D",
       oauth_timestamp="137131200",
       oauth_nonce="4572616e48616d6d65724c61686176",
       oauth_version="1.0"

```

> 

The token service validates the request and replies with a JSON payload containing a single key, `auth_session_token`, that contains the new `X-ADM-Auth-Session` token. A sample response might look like:

```javascript
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 28 Feb 2013 02:24:28 GMT
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF8
Content-Length: 47 
Connection: close

{
    "auth_session_token" : "87a235815b8d6661ac73329f75815b8d6661ac73329f815"
}

```

After a period of time, the token expires and the service returns a `401` error code. When this happens, the MDM server must request a new session token.
